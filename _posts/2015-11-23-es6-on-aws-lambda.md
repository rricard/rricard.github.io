[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is a very cool and simple service
able to run "cloud functions" very fast and cost-effectively. It is particularly
interesting if you want to process events that spawn into your AWS
infrastructure or scaffold a small API very fast.

Originally, Lambda was based on Node.js. Now lambda covers more languages with
Python 2.7 and Java 8. Unfortunately, Lambda doesn't seem to have a really
up-to-date Node.js engine preventing us from using
[Node's ES6 capabilities](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/).

With [Babel](https://babeljs.io) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io), we'll
be able to have all of the ES6 features running on Lambda.

**TL;DR;** Check out the
[example repository](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example) to run
lambdas with ES6.

## Setup webpack & babel

### Initialize and dependencies

First thing we need to do is to
[setup a basic npm package.json](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/1f61676b8972a28593a1f3d8113e0792472eac90).
It's as simple as running `npm init`.

Then, we'll need to
[import webpack, babel and its presets and plugins](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/a263795009234b0f7fecdc92220f851d509559eb).

```
npm i --save-dev webpack babel-core babel-loader json-loader \
  babel-preset-es2015 babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types \
  babel-plugin-syntax-flow
```

Note that in this example I import the webpack's `json-loader` to allow requires
on JSON files. I also import the Babel [flowtype](http://flowtype.org) plugins
to allow the use of flow type-checking annotations.

### Configure webpack

Configuring webpack is trickiest part of this tutorial but once explained,
there's no magic needed, don't worry!

Let's start with a
[basic `webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/f7787b3c24fc332f35d7117489a9eaefe4ea1afc):

```js
// webpack.config.js

var path = require("path");

module.exports = {

};
```

#### Module Loaders

I usually start my webpack config with the
[module loaders](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/bccdaf2586350604d27c4fca9ae8a8ffe9375822):

```js
module: {
  loaders: [
    {
      test: /\.js$/,
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      loader: 'babel',
      query: {
        presets: ['es2015'],
        plugins: ['syntax-flow', 'transform-flow-strip-types']
      }
    },
    {
      test: /\.json$/,
      loader: 'json'
    }
  ]
}
```

Ok, if you don't know webpack, nothing really complicated here: each js file
imported will be transformed through babel with the es2015 preset while
stripping the flow annotations. The json files will be imported like Node
would do it.

#### Output

Then, we can define
[how and where we want webpack to output my files](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/cf6e5dce81c34630d67b333262ef6ac4c83f040e):

```js
// webpack.config.js

var path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, "dist"),
    library: "[name]",
    libraryTarget: "commonjs2",
    filename: "[name].js"
  },
  target: "node",
  module: { loaders: [ /* ... */ ] }
};
```

Here are some changes between the usual output you configure when you do a web
project and what we intend to do here:

- We'll have multiple output files (one by lambda), so we need to use the
  `[name]` placeholder in our config.
- We'll need to expose those files as correct node modules, that's why `library`
  and `libraryTarget` are essential.
- We also need webpack to ignore native node deps such as `fs` or `http`, that's
  why we use the node `target`.

Don't forget to add the `dist/` directory in your `.gitignore`!

#### Entry points

Since we'll have an undefined number of lambdas, we want to list a directory
to
[use all of the files in this dir as entry points](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/8ee9824857f734d77a5cfa95b3fea6d1947a7e00).

To that end, we need to read the directory synchronously and transform the
result to something that looks like this:
`{lambda1: "./lambdas/lambda1.js", lambda2: "./lambdas/lambda2.js"}`.

```js
// webpack.config.js

var path = require("path");
var fs = require("fs");

module.exports = {
  entry: entry: fs.readdirSync(path.join(__dirname, "./lambdas"))
         .filter(filename => /\.js$/.test(filename))
         .map(filename => {
            var entry = {};
            entry[filename.replace(".js", "")] = path.join(
             __dirname,
             "./lambdas/",
             filename
           );
           return entry;
         })
         .reduce((finalObject, entry) => Object.assign(finalObject, entry), {}),
  output: { /* ... */ },
  target: "node",
  module: { loaders: [ /* ... */ ] }
};
```

Note that the precedent snippet uses arrow functions & `Object.assign()` so
you'll need to use a fairly recent node version to develop locally.

#### Try the compilation

Now, we can test a simple lambda function locally to
[test if webpack does its job correctly](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/cfb1b6d3bad6e70c99eea1903e6a0163e27fc0db).

You can now try the compilation with a simple lambda: `hello.js`

```js
// lambdas/hello.js

/* @flow */

type HelloOptions = {
  name: string
};

export function hello(options: HelloOptions, context: any): void {
  context.succeed(`Hello ${options.name || "world"}!`);
}
```

As you can see, this file uses ES6 & flow heavily.

We'll now be able to start a small script to ensure if we can execute our
lambda: `try-hello.js`

```js
// bin/try-hello.js

var helloModule = require("../dist/hello.js");

var fakeLambdaContext = {
  succeed: function succeed(results) {
    console.log(results);
    process.exit(0);
  }
};

helloModule.hello({name: "bob"}, fakeLambdaContext);
```

You can now run webpack and try to run the script:

```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
node ./bin/try-hello.js
```

#### Try on Lambda

You can also use the code generated in `dist/` directly on Lambda.

Copy the contents of `dist/hello.js` and paste it in a new lambda function.

![Manual Setup](/public/images/lambda/manual.png)

Don't forget to use the Node.js runtime and to point your handler on
`index.hello` instead of `index.handler`.

Now you can test it!

![Setup Hello Test](/public/images/lambda/setup_test_hello.png)

![Hello Test Results](/public/images/lambda/results_test_hello.png)

Note that you **can't rely on any compiled dependency**. We may see how to solve
this in an another post.

## Better local development

Now that we have everything in place to compile our lambdas, we'll try to make
things much easier for ourselves.

### Continuous webpack compilation

Each webpack run takes a lot of time. Fortunately, webpack becomes quite fast
once watching your project.

To get an easy shortcut to the webpack watcher, I advise you to
[add a script](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/28f0108f631d74254ccfde8cdfeb727e63dda870)
in your package.json.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack --watch",
  "test": "exit 1"
},
```

That way you just need to start it with `npm start`.

### Fast-exec script

Instead of creating a file to inject our options and context inside of the
imported Lambda, I created a
[small script that can be ran from your CLI](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/a41308a0d85e04d5b76d6513e8fe98088e63df51).

You can place it in `bin/run.js`:

```js
// bin/run.js

const args = process.argv;
const requiredLambda = args[2].split(".");
const lambdaModule = require(`../dist/${requiredLambda[0]}.js`);
const lambda = lambdaModule[requiredLambda[1]];
const options = JSON.parse(args[3]);

function succeed(result) {
  console.log(result);
  process.exit(0);
}

function fail(error) {
  console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
}

const context = {
  succeed: succeed,
  fail: fail,
  done: (err, res) => err ? fail(err) : succeed(res),
  getRemainingTimeInMillis: () => Infinity,
  functionName: "fakeLambda",
  functionVersion: "0",
  invokedFunctionArn: "arn:aws:lambda:fake-region:fake-acc:function:fakeLambda",
  memoryLimitInMB: Infinity,
  awsRequestId: "fakeRequest",
  logGroupName: "fakeGroup",
  logStreamName: "fakeStream",
  identity: null,
  clientContext: null
};

lambda(options, context);
```

Note again that you'll need a recent Node.js engine for local development.

This script can be executed like this:

```
# node bin/run.js $lambdaFile.$lambdaFunction $lambdaOptions
node bin/run.js hello.hello '{"name": "cli"}'
```

### Testing & Reusability

What's cool about lambdas is that they're really easy to test. It's just inputs
and outputs. Of course testing a lambda needs to setup a context.

Hopefully, we already kind of did that with the fast-exec script. All we need is
to refactor a little bit to have everything usable in mocha. More than that,
we could create a Promise wrapper to transform our lambdas into reusable
Promises in other projects.

#### Install mocha

[We need to install mocha](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/bf62e380b15db455142dbdcd54efccbd09fe556c):
`npm i --save-dev mocha`.

Mocha will need to register itself to Babel. Just insert the right script into
the package.json.

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "test": "mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register --recursive tests/"
  }
}
```

At this point we'll need a .babelrc to load our presets and plugins.
This rc could be used by webpack to load its configuration.

```js
// .babelrc
{
  "presets": ["es2015"],
  "plugins": ["syntax-flow", "transform-flow-strip-types"]
}
```

To use the same rc in webpack, just change the query in the module loader:

```js
{
  test: /\.js$/,
  exclude: /node_modules/,
  loader: 'babel',
  query: JSON.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, ".babelrc"), {encoding: "utf8"})
  )
},
```

#### Promise-wrapper

Amazon made it easy to start with Lambda but it is actually not really
standard so the lambda you can create here are not really reusable
elsewhere.

Since we are going to test them later, it may be interesting to use a standard
asynchronous API: the
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

We only use to reuse the fake context created earlier and put it in a
[promisifying function](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/860fd190f9aea4ce091f264824e87bab98e35cc5).

```js
// lib/lambda-promisifier.js

/* @flow */

import type {LambdaContext} from "./lambda-types.js";

export function lambdaPromisifier(
  lambda: (options: any, context: LambdaContext) => void
): (options: any) => Promise<any> {
  return (options: any) =>
    new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
      lambda(options, {
        succeed: resolve,
        fail: reject,
        done: (err, res) => err ? reject(err) : resolve(res),
        getRemainingTimeInMillis: () => Infinity,
        functionName: "fakeLambda",
        functionVersion: "0",
        invokedFunctionArn: "arn:aws:lambda:fake-region:fake-acc:function:fakeLambda",
        memoryLimitInMB: Infinity,
        awsRequestId: "fakeRequest",
        logGroupName: "fakeGroup",
        logStreamName: "fakeStream",
        identity: null,
        clientContext: null
      })
    );
};
```

If you use flow, you will find the `LambdaContext` type
[here](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/blob/master/lib/lambda-types.js).

#### Tests

Finally, we can now easily
[test our lambda](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/076ac7916bb36d89826a921ce14eefc088063e16)
with mocha:

```js
// tests/hello.js

import assert from "assert";

import {lambdaPromisifier} from "../lib/lambda-promisifier.js"
import {hello} from "../lambdas/hello.js"

const promisifiedHello = lambdaPromisifier(hello);

describe("hello lambda", function() {
  it("should greet the world by default", function(done) {
    promisifiedHello({})
    .then(res => {
      assert.equal(res, "Hello world!")
    })
    .then(() => done(), done);
  });

  it("should greet someone when precised", function(done) {
    promisifiedHello({name: "someone"})
    .then(res => {
      assert.equal(res, "Hello someone!")
    })
    .then(() => done(), done);
  });
});
```

You can now fire up mocha via npm: `npm t`.

## An another example: HTTP call with fetch

We'll see here how to do something really simple but that requires using
external modules: getting a webpage somewhere in the internet with the
[fetch standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org).

For that, we'll need `node-fetch` first: `npm i --save node-fetch`

[Now we can implement the lambda](https://github.com/rricard/lambda-es6-example/commit/f6182e6ddc55231a7679e4acd712a9d3651c4462)
really easily:

```js
// lambdas/fetch.js

/* @flow */

import fetch from "node-fetch";

import type {LambdaContext} from "../lib/lambda-types.js";

type FetchOptions = {
  url: string,
  method?: string,
  headers?: {[key: string]: string},
  body?: string
};

export function handler({
  url,
  method,
  headers,
  body
}: FetchOptions, context: LambdaContext): void {
  fetch(url, {
    method: method || "GET",
    headers: headers || {},
    body: body
  })
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(context.succeed, context.fail);
}
```

And a small test:

```js
// tests/fetch.js

/* @flow */

import assert from "assert";

import {lambdaPromisifier} from "../lib/lambda-promisifier.js"
import {handler} from "../lambdas/fetch.js"

const promisifiedFetch = lambdaPromisifier(handler);

describe("fetch lambda", function() {
  it("should be able to make an http call", function(done) {
    promisifiedFetch({url: "http://www.rricard.me"})
    .then(res => {
      assert(/Posts/.test(res));
    })
    .then(() => done(), done);
  });
});
```

You can test it on AWS now, you'll see that the webpack output gets quite large
but it does take all of the dependencies in account at once.

## Conclusion

Making ES6 and Lambda work together is not that hard but having proper tooling
to develop your ES6 lambdas easily require some knowledge.

I hope that this small tutorial helped you develop lambdas faster and/or
understand better the webpack compilation process.

Later I'll see if I can give you good tooling to export lambdas with compiled
dependencies and how to deploy them more easily directly on AWS (without the
copy/paste process).
