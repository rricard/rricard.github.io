title: Generative Adversarial Networks Part 2 - Implementation with Keras 2.0
---

In this part, we'll consider a very simple problem (but you can take and adapt this infrastructure to a more complex problem such as images just by changing the sample data function and the models). In our real sampled data, we'll generate random sinusoid curves and we'll try to make our GAN generate correct sinusoidal curves.

All of the code required to run the GAN is in this tutorial. All of the required imports are located at [the end](#Imports).

## Getting the "real" data

We just need to randomly generate curves, this is pretty simple to do. You can readapt this function to sample from a dataset if you want to take images for instance.

Here is the data sampling function:


```python
def sample_data(n_samples=10000, x_vals=np.arange(0, 5, .1), max_offset=100, mul_range=[1, 2]):
    vectors = []
    for i in range(n_samples):
        offset = np.random.random() * max_offset
        mul = mul_range[0] + np.random.random() * (mul_range[1] - mul_range[0])
        vectors.append(
            np.sin(offset + x_vals * mul) / 2 + .5
        )
    return np.array(vectors)

ax = pd.DataFrame(np.transpose(sample_data(5))).plot()
```

## Create the models

As we saw in the first part, we need to create a model that we will train to generate images from some noise and a model supposed to detect real data from generated data.

### Generative model

We create our generative model using simple dense layers activated by tanh. This model will take noise and try to generate sinusoidals from it. This model will not be trained directly but trained via the GAN.


```python
def get_generative(G_in, dense_dim=200, out_dim=50, lr=1e-3):
    x = Dense(dense_dim)(G_in)
    x = Activation('tanh')(x)
    G_out = Dense(out_dim, activation='tanh')(x)
    G = Model(G_in, G_out)
    opt = SGD(lr=lr)
    G.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=opt)
    return G, G_out

G_in = Input(shape=[10])
G, G_out = get_generative(G_in)
G.summary()
```

    Trainable params: 12,250.0
    Non-trainable params: 0.0
    _________________________________________________________________


### Discriminative model

Similarly, we create our discriminative model that will define if the curve is real or outputted by the generative model. This one, though will be trained directly.


```python
def get_discriminative(D_in, lr=1e-3, drate=.25, n_channels=50, conv_sz=5, leak=.2):
    x = Reshape((-1, 1))(D_in)
    x = Conv1D(n_channels, conv_sz, activation='relu')(x)
    x = Dropout(drate)(x)
    x = Flatten()(x)
    x = Dense(n_channels)(x)
    D_out = Dense(2, activation='sigmoid')(x)
    D = Model(D_in, D_out)
    dopt = Adam(lr=lr)
    D.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=dopt)
    return D, D_out

D_in = Input(shape=[50])
D, D_out = get_discriminative(D_in)
D.summary()
```

    Total params: 115,452.0
    Trainable params: 115,452.0
    Non-trainable params: 0.0
    _________________________________________________________________


### Chained model: GAN

Finally, we chain the two models into a GAN that will serve to train the generator while we freeze the discriminator.

In order to freeze the weights of a given model, we create this freezing function that we will apply on the discriminative model each time we train the GAN, in order to train the generative model.


```python
def set_trainability(model, trainable=False):
    model.trainable = trainable
    for layer in model.layers:
        layer.trainable = trainable
        
def make_gan(GAN_in, G, D):
    set_trainability(D, False)
    x = G(GAN_in)
    GAN_out = D(x)
    GAN = Model(GAN_in, GAN_out)
    GAN.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=G.optimizer)
    return GAN, GAN_out

GAN_in = Input([10])
GAN, GAN_out = make_gan(GAN_in, G, D)
GAN.summary()
```

    model_2 (Model)              (None, 2)                 115452

    Trainable params: 12,250.0
    Non-trainable params: 115,452.0
    _________________________________________________________________


## Training

Now we did setup our models, we can train the models by alterning training the discriminator and the chained models.

### Pre-training

Let's now generate some fake and real data and pre-train the discriminator before starting the gan. This also let us check if our compiled models correclty runs on our real and noisy input.


```python
def sample_data_and_gen(G, noise_dim=10, n_samples=10000):
    XT = sample_data(n_samples=n_samples)
    XN_noise = np.random.uniform(0, 1, size=[n_samples, noise_dim])
    XN = G.predict(XN_noise)
    X = np.concatenate((XT, XN))
    y = np.zeros((2*n_samples, 2))
    y[:n_samples, 1] = 1
    y[n_samples:, 0] = 1
    return X, y

def pretrain(G, D, noise_dim=10, n_samples=10000, batch_size=32):
    X, y = sample_data_and_gen(G, n_samples=n_samples, noise_dim=noise_dim)
    set_trainability(D, True)
    D.fit(X, y, epochs=1, batch_size=batch_size)

pretrain(G, D)
```

    Epoch 1/1
    20000/20000 [==============================] - 3s - loss: 0.0078     


### Alternating training steps

We can now train our GAN by alternating the training of the Discriminator and the training of the chained GAN model with Discriminator's weights freezed.


```python
def sample_noise(G, noise_dim=10, n_samples=10000):
    X = np.random.uniform(0, 1, size=[n_samples, noise_dim])
    y = np.zeros((n_samples, 2))
    y[:, 1] = 1
    return X, y

def train(GAN, G, D, epochs=500, n_samples=10000, noise_dim=10, batch_size=32, verbose=False, v_freq=50):
    d_loss = []
    g_loss = []
    e_range = range(epochs)
    if verbose:
        e_range = tqdm(e_range)
    for epoch in e_range:
        X, y = sample_data_and_gen(G, n_samples=n_samples, noise_dim=noise_dim)
        set_trainability(D, True)
        d_loss.append(D.train_on_batch(X, y))
        
        X, y = sample_noise(G, n_samples=n_samples, noise_dim=noise_dim)
        set_trainability(D, False)
        g_loss.append(GAN.train_on_batch(X, y))
        if verbose and (epoch + 1) % v_freq == 0:
            print("Epoch #{}: Generative Loss: {}, Discriminative Loss: {}".format(epoch + 1, g_loss[-1], d_loss[-1]))
    return d_loss, g_loss

d_loss, g_loss = train(GAN, G, D, verbose=True)
```

    {
        'Generative Loss': g_loss,
        'Discriminative Loss': d_loss,

ax.set_xlabel("Epochs")
ax.set_ylabel("Loss")
```

What is interesting here is that both sides are playing with each other, each learning how to get better than the other. We see that during some phases, either the generator or the discriminator is lowering its loss relative to a loss gain on the other side.

Watching the loss of the models does not seem to have a huge importance to quantify the progress in quality of the models. We actually don't really want to have models converging to zero too fast, otherwise, that means that they managed to trick each other. However the amount of times each model got better relatively to the other may be an interesting metric. to watch.

### Results

We can now vizualize some generated sinusoidal curves from our generator:


```python
N_VIEWED_SAMPLES = 2
data_and_gen, _ = sample_data_and_gen(G, n_samples=N_VIEWED_SAMPLES)
pd.DataFrame(np.transpose(data_and_gen[N_VIEWED_SAMPLES:])).plot()
```

![png](/public/images/gans/output_17_1.png)


This is not perfect, however, we see that if we smooth a bit the curve using a rolling mean, we approach a more precise sinusoidal shape.


```python
N_VIEWED_SAMPLES = 2
data_and_gen, _ = sample_data_and_gen(G, n_samples=N_VIEWED_SAMPLES)
pd.DataFrame(np.transpose(data_and_gen[N_VIEWED_SAMPLES:])).rolling(5).mean()[5:].plot()
```

Obviously with more training and more tuning, we could get better results. A greater amount of epochs usually prooves to be efficient on a GAN, but it would be long to run in a simple tutorial like this one.

Finally, we see that the generator does not takes many risks and will more or less output the same curve for different noise input. This is to be expected, our very simple model will prefer refining something it already knows to do instead of trying something new. This is a risk with GANs that can be mitigated with more varied data but will require more training overall (and a good GPU if you want this training to finish one day...).

## Conclusion

Creating GANs on keras is not a really hard task technically since all you have to do is create those 3 models and define how to do a training step with them but depending on the task you may want to achieve, more or less tuning and computations will be required.

GANs are overall very powerful but may be very hard to tune correctly especially since measuring how well they do is hard. The loss is not necessarily a good indicator and for now, the most reliable way to check if their output makes sense is to put the output in front of an actual person.
