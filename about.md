Hello ! I'm Robin Ricard, a Software Engineer working at [Bloomberg].

I mainly work on the [Bloomberg Terminal]'s infrastructure and I am an [ECMA TC39] delegate working on the [Record and Tuple] proposal.

I am an alumn of [INSA de Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/) and of [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/).
