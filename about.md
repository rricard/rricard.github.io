Hello ! I'm Robin Ricard, a software engineer.

I studied at [INSA de Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/) and at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/).

On this blog, you'll be able to read posts about pretty much anything... Just take a look, something may be interesting to you.

If you have a comment, send me a message on twitter, I'll try to fix it. I don't take public comments on the blog since I don't have time to moderate anything. Feel free though to discuss my posts on Hacker News or Reddit, I'll try to link the discussions in the post.
