Hello ! I'm Robin Ricard, a software engineering student in Computer Science.

I'm currently studying at the INSA de Lyon, France and I am looking for various opportunities: as a consultant or as an intern.

I primary work on Software Backends and DevOps but I'm also developing Android applications and Web Frontends !

Feel free to contact me if you have a project on which I can help.
